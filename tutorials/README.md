# KTS Tutorials

Use nbviewer links to read the correctly rendered notebooks or run them in binder.

Github renderer does not support widgets, so please use nbviewer instead. Running in binder, first trust the notebook manually to enable widget rendering.

## Titanic

This tutorial is based on [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
